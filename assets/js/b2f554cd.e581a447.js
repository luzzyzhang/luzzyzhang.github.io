Concurrent use\\nof shared resources can be a source of indeterminacy leading to issues such as\\ndeadlocks, and resource starvation.\\n\\nDesign of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for\\ncoordinating their execution, data exchange, memory allocation, and execution\\nscheduling to minimize response time and maximise throughput.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n# References\\n\\n- [Wikipedia concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science))\\n- [Wikipedia concurrent computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)\\n- [Wikipeida parallel programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_programming)"}]}')}}]);
