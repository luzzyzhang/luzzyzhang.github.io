This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which\\ncan significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and\\nmulti-core systems. In more technical terms, concurrency refers to the\\ndecomposability of a program, algorithm, or problem into order-independent or\\npartially-ordered components or units of computation.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAccording to Rob Pike, concurrency is the composition of independently\\nexecuting computations, and concurrency is not parallelism: **concurrency is\\nabout dealing with lots of things at once but parallelism is about doing lots\\nof things at once.** Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about\\nexecution, concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a\\nproblem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.\\n\\nA number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent\\ncomputation including Petri nets, process calculi, the parallel random-access\\nmachine model, the actor model and the Reo Coordination Language.\\n\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nConcurrency is about structure, parallelism is about\\nexecution, concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a\\nproblem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Issues\\n\\nBecause computations in a concurrent system can interact with each other while\\nbeing executed, the number of possible execution paths in the system can be\\nextremely large, and the resulting outcome can be indeterminate. Concurrent use\\nof shared resources can be a source of indeterminacy leading to issues such as\\ndeadlocks, and resource starvation.\\n\\nDesign of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for\\ncoordinating their execution, data exchange, memory allocation, and execution\\nscheduling to minimize response time and maximise throughput.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n# References\\n\\n- [Wikipedia concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science))\\n- [Wikipedia concurrent computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)\\n- [Wikipeida parallel programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_programming)"}]}')}}]);
