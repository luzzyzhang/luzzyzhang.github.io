            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm,
or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting
the outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which
can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and
multi-core systems. In more technical terms, concurrency refers to the
decomposability of a program, algorithm, or problem into order-independent or
partially-ordered components or units of computation.</p><p>According to Rob Pike, concurrency is the composition of independently
executing computations, and concurrency is not parallelism: <strong>concurrency is
about dealing with lots of things at once but parallelism is about doing lots
of things at once.</strong> Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about
execution, concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a
problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.</p><p>A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent
computation including Petri nets, process calculi, the parallel random-access
machine model, the actor model and the Reo Coordination Language.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about

being executed, the number of possible execution paths in the system can be
extremely large, and the resulting outcome can be indeterminate. Concurrent use
of shared resources can be a source of indeterminacy leading to issues such as
deadlocks, and resource starvation.</p><p>Design of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for
coordinating their execution, data exchange, memory allocation, and execution
scheduling to minimize response time and maximise throughput.</p><hr><h1>References</h1><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia concurrency</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia concurrent computing</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipeida parallel programming</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
